# DC-DC Boost Converter – PCB Design (KiCad)
# Introduction
This repository contains the KiCad PCB design files for a basic DC-DC Boost Converter. The design is intended for educational, prototyping, and experimentation purposes. It is based on the popular XL6009 step-up converter IC and supports converting lower DC input voltages (like 3.7V or 5V) to higher output voltages such as 9V or 12V.
# Project Summary
🔧 IC Used: XL6009
📐 Design Files: Schematic and PCB layout only
💻 Software: Designed in KiCad 7
🔌 Estimated Output Current: Up to 1A 
🔋 Use Case: Basic boost conversion for low-power devices
