# DC-DC Boost Converter

# Introduction
This repository contains the KiCad PCB design files for a basic DC-DC Boost Converter. It is based on the popular XL6009 step-up converter IC and supports converting lower DC input voltages 5V to higher output voltages such as 9V or 12V.

# Components
-XL6009 step up IC

-33µH inductor

-SS32 Schottky diode

-Adjustable feedback network (RV1 + R1)

-Input/output filtering capacitors for stability
